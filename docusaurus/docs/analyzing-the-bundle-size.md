[Source map explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) analyzes
JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code
bloat is coming from.

To add Source map explorer to a Create React App project, follow these steps:

```sh
npm install --save source-map-explorer
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add source-map-explorer
```

Then in `package.json`, add the following line to `scripts`:

```diff
   "scripts": {
+    "analyze": "source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "test": "react-scripts test",
```

Then to analyze the bundle run the production build then run the analyze
script.

```sh
npm run build
npm run analyze
```
